### Hi there 👋

My name is Sergey and I'm currently working with the mobile scanning platform [Anyline GmbH](https://anyline.com). We use **TypeScript, Nest, React, PostgreSQL**, and **GCP**. **Go** is my second favorite language because of its simplicity and elegancy.

**Python** was the first language I used in production and I still appreciate its' syntax simplicity and expressiveness.

Also, I love **🦀️ Rust** and new tech in general, so feel free to drop me a line if you'd like me to do some 🔬 R&D projects for you.

⚡ Fun fact: I have returned from Asia just two days before lockdown due to COVID-19.
