### Hi there 👋

My name is Sergey and I'm currently working on the **docs-like-code** CI/CD service in [Redoc.ly](https://redoc.ly). We use **TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Postgraphile**, and **AWS**. 

Also, I love **🦀️ Rust** and new tech in general, so feel free to drop me a line if you'd like me to do some 🔬 R&D projects for you.
